## What is EVoting?
`EVoting` is an electronic voting system based on blockchain technology.
- With the help of the `EVoting` web application, any visitor to the site has access to view a list of all votes and details about each vote: 
title or main question, voting time and status (did not start, in progress and completed), answer options and, if the vote is completed,
his results. For each created vote, an individual link is displayed in the Etherscan blockchain explorer. Site visitor can
find a vote by title or topic, and filter votes by their status. To log in to the system, the guest must connect the MetaMask web3 provider to work with the blockchain.
- An authorized user can create a new vote by filling in the form fields and signing a transaction to add a vote to blockchain in MetaMask. 
This type of user can vote if he is invited to a certain vote, the vote is not yet completed and, if the user signed the token (vote) transfer transaction 
to the selected answer option in MetaMask. In the event that an authorized the user voted, when viewing the voting details, 
a link to the "votes" transaction is displayed in the blockchain explorer etherscan.
